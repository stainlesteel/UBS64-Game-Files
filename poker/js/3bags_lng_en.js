And then it goes clockwise. Before the players receive the first cards, the two players at the left of the dealer bet so-called <strong>blinds</strong> - mandatory bets that give the beginning to the game. The player at the left of the dealer bets half of the amount of the obligatory bet – the <strong>small blind</strong>. The next player bets a complete bet called the <strong>big blind</strong>. Then each player receives two cards from the deck and preliminary round called <strong>pre-flop</strong> begins. First moves the player sitting to the <strong>left</strong> of the <strong>big blind</strong>. He can put an amount equal to the big blind, raise the bet or pass. If the player decides to fold,  then he is not involved in this round. The turn passes to the next player in a clockwise direction until each player is given an opportunity to bet, raise or fold. Then <strong>three cards</strong> are laid from the deck on the table. This round is called  <strong>flop</strong>. Each player, as usual, can confirm the bet, raise it or fold. Then  the <strong>next card</strong> is opened and begins the next betting round - the <strong>turn</strong>.
